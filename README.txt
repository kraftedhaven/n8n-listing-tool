1. API Gateway / Router
Prompt:
Write a FastAPI app called gateway.py that:

Provides endpoints for /upload, /generate-listing, /syndicate, /research, /status

Handles user authentication (JWT or API key‚Äîuse simple local secret for now)

Logs all requests/responses (including errors) to the console for auditability

Proxies requests to the correct internal microservice endpoints (use dummy URLs/composable structure)

Add clear comments showing how to adapt for eventual scaling to serverless/cloud (Google Cloud Run)

Dockerize for easy cloud deployment

2. AI Description & ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù Generator
Prompt:
Build a Python FastAPI app named ai_service.py that:

Accepts an image file and optional metadata (category, color, etc)

Calls OpenAI‚Äôs API (or provides a mock function) to:

Extract visual keywords

Compose an SEO-rich, poetic product title, detailed description, a unique tagline, and a ‚Äúmetaphysical energy score‚Äù from 1-10 (explain the score in one sentence)

Suggest 5 trending hashtags for resale (eBay/Etsy)

Returns a JSON object with all generated fields

Handles basic upload validation, returns user-friendly error messages, and logs for review

3. Image Upload Service
Prompt:
Write a small FastAPI service (image_upload.py) that:

Accepts single/batch images

Stores them in a folder (for demo), returns URLs (just local for now), and generates a hash for each

(Include comments for later adapting to Google Cloud Storage)

Checks for duplicate images, and explains in the JSON response if a duplicate was found

4. Market Syndication Orchestrator
Prompt:
Create a Python app (syndicate.py) that:

Takes in product info and images via API POST request

Mocks a call to eBay, Etsy, Facebook Marketplace (just prints ‚ÄúPosted to ___; success=true‚Äù for now), returns fake listing IDs/URLs

Structures code clearly to swap in real API integrations later (using classes or functions for each platform)

Returns a summary object: platforms posted to, fake URLs/IDs, errors if any

5. Product Research & Trend Insight Service
Prompt:
Write a FastAPI app (research.py) that:

Offers /trends endpoint: returns a (fake for now) list of 5 trending products, prices, and keywords (manually hardcode a sample response)

Offers /insights endpoint: accepts a product category, returns a short report with best prices, best keywords to use, and ‚Äúquantum insight‚Äù (e.g., color, day, or time the item is most likely to sell)

Structure endpoints for easy connection to real APIs or scrapers in the future

6. Frontend App (Minimal Demo, Expandable)
Prompt:
Scaffold a React (or Vue) SPA that:

Lets user upload images, enter optional product details

Shows a live preview of AI-generated title, description, energy score, hashtags, and listing previews for eBay/Etsy/Facebook

Includes upload button, simple drag-drop area, and a results display card

Style for modern, positive energy (soft gradients, icons)

Clearly comment the code for easy extension and API integration

7. n8n Workflow Integration
Prompt:
Describe an n8n automation flow that:

Watches cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive or S3) for new images

Automatically sends the image to the AI Description Service

Receives generated listing data, then posts to Market Syndication API (sequentially for each platform)

On completion, writes the results to Google Sheets and sends a summary message to the user via email or Discord webhook

Document how to export/import this workflow for others

8. Cloud-Ready Infrastructure
Prompt:
Write clear, beginner-friendly Dockerfiles for each microservice above.
Draft a docker-compose.yml file that launches gateway, ai_service, image_upload, syndicate, research, and a sample frontend‚Äîall with correct networking and comments.
Write a note explaining how to connect these to Google Cloud Run or GitHub Codespaces for zero-local setup.

üöÄ ‚ÄúTruly Out There‚Äù Ideas‚ÄîEasy to Make, Unique Features
A. Manifestation ‚ÄúAura Scanner‚Äù Mini-Service
Prompt:
Build a new Python FastAPI endpoint /aura-scan that:

Takes an uploaded image (product or selfie)

Randomly returns a metaphysical ‚Äúaura color‚Äù (e.g., blue = calm, gold = abundance) and a one-line fortune/affirmation for the seller or item, chosen from a list

Returns JSON: {aura_color: "Gold", meaning: "Abundance", affirmation: "What you wish multiplies now."}

Clearly comment where to add more AI or metaphysical logic in the future

B. ‚ÄúSentient Listing Note‚Äù Generator
Prompt:
Create a FastAPI endpoint /bless-listing that:

On POST, takes a product‚Äôs title/description

Uses OpenAI (or a randomizer for demo) to generate a heartfelt, poetic ‚Äúthank you/blessing note‚Äù for the future buyer, e.g., ‚ÄúMay this item bring you joy and inspiration!‚Äù

Returns the blessing as plain text (and as HTML for frontend display)

Document how to call this from a n8n workflow and show it in your listing preview
